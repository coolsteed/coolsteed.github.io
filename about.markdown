My name is Bolun and I am a Ph.D. candidate in the department of sociology, UCSD. Before coming to UCSD, I got my bachelor (Arabic and Sociology) and master degree (Sociology) from Peking University.

Trained in different traditions and methods, I am constituted by three (or more) selves: a political sociologist self, a political economist self, and finally, a social historian self. With a relatively simple life story, my research is largely driven by my curiosity.

My master thesis explores the labour movement in Egypt during the Liberal Age (1922-1952), answering why workers from different industrial centers in textile industry developed different labour activism. I argue that different conceptions of worker and company forged different relations between skilled workers and unskilled workers, and further closed political opportunity for workers in Mahalla al-Kubra while opened other chances for workers in Shubra al-Khayma.

I am now working on my Ph.D. project on the issue of FDI and informational capitalism, with an empirical focus on Chinese outward investment.

I am an advanced amateur in Arabic and coding. You can find some open-sourced datasets, courses and packages (incoming) created by me in my Github.
