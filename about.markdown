My name is Bolun and I am a assistant professor in the department of sociology, Zhejiang University. Before coming to ZJU, I got my bachelor (Arabic and Sociology), master degree (Sociology) from Peking University, and my PhD degree (Sociology) from UCSD. I am a founding member of the Center of Critical Computational Social Science in ZJU.

I am a researcher of infrastructure and specialize in economic sociology and political sociology. My works explore the material political economy of China/Global China both ethnographically and historically. I am particularly interested in how the organization configures the relation between the materiality and the political-economic regime, and how to extend our understanding of the politics based on it. 

I am an advanced amateur in Arabic and coding. You can find some open-sourced datasets, courses and packages (incoming) created by me in my Github.
