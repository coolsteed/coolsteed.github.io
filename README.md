> 我不是真理的朋友，我也不在谬误这一边。某种意义上，真理与谬误是同一种东西，是知识-权力之轴，它们都在被照亮的历史之中，相互转换。如果要说我钟情于什么，毋宁说我是愚昧的友人：它在昏暗的交界处，在街道的杂乱、车间的吵闹和酒馆的喧嚣中安身，它是习俗、传统和传说，是被贬斥为无理性的生命。它被书写，却拒绝消失。我所知道的只是，日常无一不来自其中。

I am a Ph.D. student in the department of sociology, UCSD. Before coming to the U.S., I got my bachelor (Arabic and Sociology) and master degree (Sociology) from Peking University.

I am a researcher of infrastructure and specialize in economic sociology and political sociology. My works explore the material political economy of China/Global China both ethnographically and historically. I am particularly interested in how the organization configures the relation between the materiality and the political-economic regime, and how to extend our understanding of the politics based on it. 

I am an advanced amateur in Arabic and coding. You can find some open-sourced datasets, courses and packages (incoming) created by me in my Github.
