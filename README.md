> 我不是真理的朋友，我也不在谬误这一边。某种意义上，真理与谬误是同一种东西，是知识-权力之轴，它们都在被照亮的历史之中，相互转换。如果要说我钟情于什么，毋宁说我是愚昧的友人：它在昏暗的交界处，在街道的杂乱、车间的吵闹和酒馆的喧嚣中安身，它是习俗、传统和传说，是被贬斥为无理性的生命。它被书写，却拒绝消失。我所知道的只是，日常无一不来自其中。

I am a Ph.D. student in the department of sociology, UCSD. Before coming to the U.S., I got my bachelor (Arabic and Sociology) and master degree (Sociology) in Peking University.

Trained in different traditions and methods, I am constituted by three (or more) selves: a political sociologist self, a political economist self, and finally, a social historian self. With a relatively simple life story, my research is largely driven by my curiosity.

My master thesis explores the labour movement in Egypt during the Liberal Age (1922-1952), answering why workers from different industrial centers in textile industry developed different labour activism. I argue that different conceptions of worker and company forged different relations between skilled workers and unskilled workers, and further closed political opportunity for workers in Mahalla al-Kubra while opened other chances for workers in Shubra al-Khayma.

I am now working on my Ph.D. project on the issue of FDI and informational captialism, with an empirical focus on Chinese outward investment.

I am an advanced amateur in Arabic and coding. You can find some open-sourced datasets, courses and packages (incoming) created by me in my Github.
