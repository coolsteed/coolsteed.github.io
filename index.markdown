> 我不是真理的朋友，我也不在谬误这一边。某种意义上，真理与谬误是同一种东西，是知识-权力之轴，它们都在被照亮的历史之中，相互转换。如果要说我钟情于什么，毋宁说我是愚昧的友人：它在昏暗的交界处，在街道的杂乱、车间的吵闹和酒馆的喧嚣中安身，它是习俗、传统和传说，是被贬斥为无理性的生命。它很少被书写，却拒绝消失。我所知道的只是，日常无一不来自其中。

> I am not a friend of truth, nor am I on the side of fallacy. These two, in a certain sense, are the same thing, the knowledge-power axis. They are located in a history that is highlighted, and transmute to each other time by time. If I must name something that I am fond of, then I would rather say I am the friend of ingenuousness. It alights around the murky boundaries, and takes shelter in the chaos of streets, noise of workshops and hubbub of bars. It has been seldomly written, but always refuses to disappear. All I know is that the everyday life comes from it.
